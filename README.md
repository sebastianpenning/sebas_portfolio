This was a project that used the World wide importers sample data base for Microsoft SQL. After initial explorting and querying with SQL. The data was cleaned and transformed further with Pandas. In this step, new collumns of data were added to simulate the impact of discounts on revenue. Finally, the data was loaded into Tableau, in which visualizations were created to give an overview of the different aspects of the data. This has been spread over two dashboards, the first with a general overview, and the second with a deeper analysis of underlying trends

This project used sales data collected over the period of 2012-2016 to create a time series forecasting with R. The data was first cleaned and reformated to be able to be used for a forecasting. After reformating the data to the right data type, it was sorted and grouped together according to month. Following a prelimary analysis, the trend was removed using difference and the seasonality was taken out of the data. Finally, after fitting the data with different models, the ETS model was chosen to run the forecast.

In this project, the data contains information about the selling of different commodities prices and quantities around the US. After cleaning the data, by dropping, reodering, and creating new collumns, a exploratory data analysis was undertaken in order to have a general impression of the data. This include which items were sold the most versus the least, which vendors performed the best versus the least, sales per state, historical sales evolution, and which products sold together the most.

This project contains supply chain health commodity shipment and pricing data from the US. It was reformated to fit more into a commercial scenario. The purpose of this project was to prepare data in Excel to be used for a dashboard which was also created in Excel. Succeding initial data cleaning and reformating, which included removal of not used variables and missing data, several pivot tables were made. These pivot tables tried to visualize the costs in relationship to lead time discrepencies, which finally results in the dashboard.
